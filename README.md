- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam
- 👀 I’m interested in too much
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use my brain properly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just learning for now
- 📫 How to reach me ... not yet :(
- 😄 Pronouns: ... whatever floats your goat on a boat in a mote
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... it's never too late, I've never felt more capable and rising desire to learn than right now, after spending most of my 20's recovering from a nasty psychosis. You are not wasting time. Your brain is powerful. Keep healing.
